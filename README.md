# AugmentedAssembly
Diploma thesis

This paper seeks to explore the possibility to utilize XR (extended reality) in industrial
assembly. The aim is to implement a system, which is able to visually navigate the
operator during the product assembly process by the means of object recognition and
image augmentation. The first chapter presents the use-case of augmented reality in the
industry. The next part consists of research on the topic of augmented and virtual reality
devices and provides a brief comparison of the current state of the art. Afterwards, a
methodology is presented for object recognition of an arbitrary object. The
implementation is able to detect the object in real-time, is resilient to occlusion and
contains the information about the objectâ€™s orientation.
